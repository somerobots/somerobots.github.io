    <p>
      When you register your device for Push Notifications, we transmit your OAuth token via HTTPS to our Push Server. Your OAuth token is used to periodically poll GitHub for activity.
    </p>
    <p>
      We use Gemnasium to automatically monitor dependency vulnerabilities for our Push Server, our current status is as follows: <a href='https://gemnasium.com/github.com/mattsrobot/NotificationsServer'><img src="https://gemnasium.com/badges/ff0df57bbee44854f6b8145bd49e99fb.svg" alt="Dependency Status" /></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Our Push Server is entirely hosted on Heroku, which keeps the base platform up-to-date from security vulnerabilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      We check inputs for the correct types and take steps to mitigate things like SQL Injection attacks.
    </p>
    <p>
      If there is ever a detected security breach we'll revoke Trident's GitHub API token access directly, we'll also alert users of this breach through Twitter, Website updates and the E-mail address you used to register for Push Notifications.
