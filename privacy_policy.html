    <p>
      Trident uses Twitter Fabric.io (Answers) to send analytics about how you generally use the App. We send events such as when you view your Pull Requests, create an Issue, determine if you're using GitHub or GitLab, and many other events. We don't send sensitive information about you or your projects contents in these activity events and we absolutely respect your privacy. We use these events to better understand what features are being used in Trident.

    <p>
      Trident uses Twitter Crashlytics for crash reports. Crash report results will only ever be used to fix issues with Trident.
