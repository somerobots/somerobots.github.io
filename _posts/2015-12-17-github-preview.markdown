v1.4 of Trident adds GitHub support.

This is an early preview, limited to issues and repository files. I've already started work on v1.5 - you can see the plans v1.5 in the GitHub [issue tracker](https://github.com/somerobots/Trident/issues).

I'm really excited to add GitHub support, and look forward to making Trident work perfectly with it.

This is what you'll see when you login to a GitHub project with Trident v1.4.
