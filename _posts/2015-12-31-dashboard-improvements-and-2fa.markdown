v1.4.1 should be landing very soon (I have submitted it to App store review) - I expect in first or second week of January.

- GitLab login now shows HTTPS toggle - incase you're not using SSL.
- Added support for GitLab starred projects (only available in GitLab 8.3+ hosts).
- Added support for GitHub 2FA.
- Improved the dashboard, goto issues, merge requests and git pushes, straight from the dashboard!
- Improved history screen, even faster loading of comments.
- Fixes issue with spinner showing incorrectly in Issues tab.
- Increased height of tab bar slightly (48pt).
- Markdown is cached (in-memory) for speedier scrolling.
- Some small bug fixes and performance gains.
