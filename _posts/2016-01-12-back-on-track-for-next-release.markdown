Earlier I wrote about [v1.4.1](http://somerobots.com/news/update/2015/12/31/dashboard-improvements-and-2fa.html), however due to some bugs discovered during the TestFlight - GitHub 2FA Authentication wasn't working correctly, the release was delayed. However, I'm happy to say it's now back waiting for review again (thanks to the TestFlight testers)

- Added support for iPad.
- Added support for landscape.
- Added support for GitLab Project Avatars.
- Added support for GitLab starred projects (only available in GitLab 8.3+ hosts).
- Added support for GitHub 2FA.
- Added support for GitHub Pull Requests.
- GitLab login now shows HTTPS toggle - incase you're not using SSL.
- Improved darkmode, it's now App wide!
- Improved the dashboard, goto issues, merge requests and git pushes, straight from the dashboard!
- Improved history screen, even faster loading of comments.
- History and Dashboard now support lazy load issue and merge requests.
- Fixes issue with central spinner showing incorrectly.
- Increased height of tab bar slightly (48pt).
- Markdown is cached (in-memory) for speedier scrolling.
- Fixes some performance issue when switching tabs too often.
