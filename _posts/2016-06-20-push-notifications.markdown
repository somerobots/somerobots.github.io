I'm really excited to announce ```v1.5.1``` has landed on the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id983962683), for the week I've been carefully monitoring the Push Notifications server. Over 2k notifications have been pushed in that time, so it seems to be handling ok! Will be adding some future incremental updates to improve this for iOS 10, as well as some fixes for GitLab login for 2FA security.

Did you know I'm looking for a cofounder to help build Trident? Read more about this [here](https://github.com/somerobots/Trident/issues/28).
