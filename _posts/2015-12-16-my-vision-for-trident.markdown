Trident aims to make platforms like GitLab and GitHub more engaging for teams of developers with their issues and merge requests. This means making discussion around code and issues a central part of Trident's goals.

I feel much like Facebook has made my interaction with the website now through mobile, there is a similar possibility for GitLab and GitHub - for certain types of people. Trident is suited for teams of people working together on projects. People aren't always at their desk when they are doing work, I think increasingly teams work more mobile.   

Though Tridents focus is discussions, it does not aim to be a realtime chat application. Issues and merge requests are deeply considered things. The core focus will be beautifully rendering issues and merge requests, and making the discussion interface extremely efficient.

I look forward to improving Trident to reach these goals.

Thanks for your support!
